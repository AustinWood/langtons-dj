Typically thought of as a <i>visualization</i> of mathematical-based evolution, my goal with Langton's DJ is to give us an additional dimension — a dimension of <i>musicality</i> — from which to observe and appreciate the complex emergent behavior which results from a simple set of rules and initial conditions.</p>\n        <p>Each beat ants rotate either left or right depending on which color they are currently located, then move forward one step while changing the color of the cell they've left behind.</p>\n        <p>While all ants follow the same set of rules for movement, in Langton's DJ, each ant is responsible for one voicing in the deterministically emergent four-point harmony: soprano, alto, tenor and bass. Similar to the rules for movement, each ant has a set of rules that determines which note it should play based on which color it is situated.</p>\n        <p>For example, the rules for the Tetrachords configuration are as follows:</p>\n        <table>\n          <tr>\n            <th className=\"row-header\">Color</th>\n            <th><div className=\"table-circle\" id=\"blue-circle\"></div></th>\n            <th><div className=\"table-circle\" id=\"green-circle\"></div></th>\n            <th><div className=\"table-circle\" id=\"pink-circle\"></div></th>\n            <th><div className=\"table-circle\" id=\"purple-circle\"></div></th>\n            <th><div className=\"table-circle\" id=\"yellow-circle\"></div></th>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <th className=\"row-header\">Direction</th>\n            <th>Right</th>\n            <th>Left</th>\n            <th>Right</th>\n            <th>Right</th>\n            <th>Left</th>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <th className=\"row-header\">Soprano</th>\n            <th>B5</th>\n            <th>C5</th>\n            <th>A5</th>\n            <th>B♭6</th>\n            <th>A6</th>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <th className=\"row-header\">Alto</th>\n            <th>B4</th>\n            <th>C4</th>\n            <th>A4</th>\n            <th>B♭5</th>\n            <th>A5</th>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <th className=\"row-header\">Tenor</th>\n            <th>G♭3</th>\n            <th>E♭3</th>\n            <th>A♭3</th>\n            <th>D4</th>\n            <th>A♭4</th>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <th className=\"row-header\">Bass</th>\n            <th>E2</th>\n            <th>F3</th>\n            <th>G3</th>\n            <th>D♭</th>\n            <th>F3</th>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n        <p>I am very grateful to the music theory subreddit community for helping me come up with the different arrangement of notes.
